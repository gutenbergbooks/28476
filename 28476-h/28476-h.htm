<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>DERIVATION OF THE WORD "ISLAND."</h3>

  <p>Lexicographers from time to time have handed down to us, and proposed
  for our choice, two derivations of our English word <i>Island</i>; and,
  that one of these two is correct, has, I believe, never yet been called
  in question. The first which they offer, and that most usually accepted
  as the true one, is the A.-S. <i>Ealand</i>, <i>Ealond</i>,
  <i>Igland</i>; Belg. <i>Eylandt</i>: the first syllable of which, they
  inform us, is <i>ea</i>, Low Germ. <i>aue</i>, water, <i>i.e.</i>
  water-land, or land surrounded by water. If this etymon be deemed
  unsatisfactory, they offer the following: from the Fr. <i>isle</i>, It.
  <i>isola</i>, Lat. <i>insula</i>, the word <i>island</i>, they say, is
  easily deflected.</p>

  <p>At the risk of being thought presumptuous, I do not hesitate to say,
  that both these alternatives are manifestly erroneous; and, for the
  following reason, I propose a third source, which seems to carry
  conviction with it: first, from analogy; and secondly, from the usage of
  the language from which our English word is undoubtedly derived, the
  Anglo-Saxon.</p>

  <p>First, from analogy. Let us only consider how frequently names are
  given to parts of our hills, shores, rivers, &amp;c., from their supposed
  resemblance to parts of the human body. Thus, for instance, we have a
  <i>head</i> land, a <i>neck</i> of land, a <i>tongue</i> of land, a
  <i>nose</i> of land (as in Ness, in Orfordness, Dungeness, and, on the
  opposite coast, Grinez); also a <i>mouth</i> of a river or harbour, a
  <i>brow</i> of a hill, <i>back</i> or <i>chine</i> of a hill, <i>foot</i>
  of a hill; an <i>arm</i> of the sea, <i>sinus</i> or bosom of the sea.
  With these examples, and many more like them, before us, why should we
  ignore an <i>eye</i> of land as unlikely to be the original of our word
  <i>island</i>? The correspondence between the two is exact. How
  frequently is the term <i>eye</i> applied to any small spot standing by
  itself, and peering out as it were, in fact an <i>insulated</i> spot:
  thus we have the <i>eye</i> of an apple, the <i>eye</i> or centre of a
  target, the <i>eye</i> of a stream (<i>i.e.</i> where the stream collects
  into a point&mdash;a point well known to salmon fishers), and very many
  other instances. What more natural term, then, to apply to a spot of land
  standing alone in the midst of an expanse of water than an <i>eye</i> of
  land? <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span></p>

  <p>In confirmation of this view, let us look to the original language;
  there we find the compounds of <i>eag</i>, <i>ea</i>, <i>ægh</i>, the
  eye, of very frequent occurrence: all of them showing that this compound
  <i>ea-land</i> is not only legitimate, but extremely probable. Thus we
  find, <i>eag-æple</i>, the pupil of the eye; <i>eag-dura</i>, a
  window-light, eye-door; <i>eag ece</i>, pain in the eye;
  <i>eah-hringas</i>, the orbits of the eyes. In the last instance, the
  <i>g</i> is dropped; and it is certain that <i>eag</i> was pronounced
  nearly as eye now is. From all this, is it too much to conclude that
  <i>ea-land</i> is the same as <i>eye-land</i>? But farther, <i>Ig</i>
  (A.-S.) sometimes stands by itself for an island, as also do
  <i>Igland</i> and <i>Igoth</i>, and <i>Ii</i> was the old name of Iona.
  Now I cannot find that there ever was the slightest connexion between the
  A.-S. <i>Ig</i> and <i>water</i>; nor do I believe that such an idea
  would ever have been started, but to support the old derivation of the
  word; I have never seen a genuine instance of such connexion brought
  forward. Then the word <i>Ig</i>, if it be supposed to mean an
  <i>eye</i>, as I contend, may very well stand by itself for
  <i>island</i>; but, if <i>water</i> be expressed by it, I cannot
  understand how it can serve to import <i>land</i>.</p>

  <p>If any farther confirmation be wanted, we have it in the diminutive
  <i>eyot</i>, of which <i>ait</i>, <i>aight</i>, <i>eight</i> are
  corruptions.</p>

<h3>WEATHER RULES.</h3>

  <p>Thomas Passenger, who dwelt at the Three Bibles and Star, on London
  Bridge, was very celebrated during the latter part of the seventeenth
  century for publishing popular histories and chap-books. His shop seems
  to have been the principal place of resort for the hawkers who then
  supplied the provinces with literature. Many of the works which issued
  from his press are now very rare: one of the most curious, and, at the
  same time, the rarest, is <i>The Shepherd's Kalendar: or, the Citizen's
  and Country Man's Daily Companion</i>, &amp;c. The contents of this book
  are of a very singular nature, it being a kind of epitome of the facts it
  was then thought necessary for a countryman to be acquainted with. A
  considerable portion of the work is occupied by remarks on the weather,
  and on lucky and unlucky days: if I were to extract all on those
  subjects, this communication would extend to an unreasonable length.</p>

  <p>We are informed, under the head "Observations on Remarkable Days, to
  know how the whole Year will succeed in Weather, Plenty," &amp;c.,
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If the sun shine clear and bright on Christmas-day, it promiseth a
  peaceable year from clamours and strife, and foretells much plenty to
  ensue; but if the wind blow stormy towards sunset, it betokeneth sickness
  in the spring and autumn quarters."</p>

  <p>"If January 25 (being St. Paul's day) be fair, it promises a happy
  year; but if cloudy, windy, or rainy, otherwise: hear in this case what
  an ancient judicious astrologer writes:</p>

      <p>Then will be dear all sorts of grain:</p>
      <p>Or if the wind do blow aloft,</p>
      <p>Great stirs will vex the world full oft;</p>
      <p>And if dark clouds do muff the sky,</p>
      <p>Then foul and cattle oft will die.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Mists or hoar frosts on the tenth of March betokens (<i>sic</i>) a
  plentiful year, but not without some diseases."</p>

  <p>"If, in the fall of the leaf in October, many of them wither on the
  bows, and hang there, it betokens a frosty winter and much snow."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Under "The Signs of Rain in Creatures" we have the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the hern or bitron flies low, the air is gross, and thickening
  into showers."</p>

  <p>"The froggs much croaking in ditches and pools, &amp;c., in the
  evening, foretells rain in little time to follow: also, the sweating of
  stone pillars or tombs denotes rain."</p>

  <p>"The often doping or diving of water fowl foreshows rain is at
  hand."</p>

  <p>"The peacock's much crying denotes rain."</p>

<h3>ON THE MODERN PRACTICE OF ASSUMING ARMS.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If any person be advanced into an office or dignity of publique
  administration, be it eyther ecclesiasticall, martiall, or ciuill: so
  that the same office comprehendeth in it <i>dignitatem vel dignitatis
  titulum</i>, either dignitie or (at the least) a title of dignitye: the
  Heralde must not refuse to devise to such a publique person, upon his
  instant request and willingnes to beare the same without reproche, a
  coate of armes: and thenceforth to matriculate him, with his <!-- Page 51
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>intermarriages,
  and issues descending, in the register of the Gentle and Noble."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus wrote Sir John Ferne in <i>The Blazon of Gentrie</i>, printed in
  the year 1586. So also Coates, in his additions to Gwillim, writing in
  1724, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"For though arms, in their first acceptation, were (as is shewed)
  taken up at any gentleman's pleasure, yet hath that liberty for many ages
  been deny'd, and they, by regal authority, made the rewards and ensigns
  of merit, &amp;c., the gracious favours of princes; no one being, by the
  law of gentility in England, allowed the bearing thereof, but those that
  either have them by descent, or grant, or purchase from the body or badge
  of any prisoner they in open and lawful war had taken."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He proceeds to adduce various authorities on this subject, for which I
  would refer to the Introduction to the last edition of Gwillim's
  <i>Heraldry</i>, p. 16. &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Porny defines <i>assumptive arms</i> to be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Such as are taken up by the caprice or fancy of <i>upstarts</i>, who,
  being advanced to a degree of fortune, assume them without having
  deserved them by any glorious action. This, indeed (he adds), is <i>great
  abuse of heraldry</i>; but yet so common, and so much tolerated, almost
  everywhere, that little or no notice is taken of it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was written in 1765. Archdeacon Nares, in his very amusing
  <i>Heraldic Anomalies</i>, printed in 1823, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At present, <i>similarity of name</i> is quite enough to lead any man
  to conclude himself to be a branch of some very ancient or noble stock,
  and, if occasion arise, to assume the arms appropriate to such families,
  without any appeal to the Heralds' office; nor would any <i>Alderman
  Gathergrease</i>, living in affluence, be without such marks and symbols
  on his plate, seals, carriages, &amp;c., with no higher authority,
  perhaps, than his own fancy and conceit."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It must be confessed that the middle of the nineteenth century offers
  the most ample facilities for the would-be aristocrats of the age, and
  <i>that</i> without troubling Sir Charles Young or the College of Arms;
  witness the following advertisement cut from a newspaper of the
  day:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">The Family Livery</span>.&mdash;Arms and Crests
  correctly ascertained, and in any case a steel die expressly cut for the
  buttons, free of cost," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There can, indeed, be no doubt that this foolish practice of assuming
  arms without right has of late years grown to an absurd height; and I
  fear the assumption is by no means confined to persons who have risen by
  trade, or by some lucky speculation in railways &amp;c.; even those who
  have been "<i>advanced into an office or dignity of publique
  administration</i>" have but seldom made their "<i>instant request</i>"
  to the heralds "<i>to devise a coate of armes to be borne by them without
  reproch</i>."</p>

  <p>The episcopal bench, in particular, are very generally faulty in this
  respect, and, for the greater part, content themselves (if not by birth
  entitled to bear arms) by assuming the coat of some old-established
  family of the same, or <i>nearly the same</i>, name. In the case of
  temporal peerages, which are not seldom, thanks to the ancient
  constitution of England, renovated from the middle and lower classes, the
  practice is more in accordance with the precepts of <i>The Blazon of
  Gentrie</i>; but I believe there is at least <i>one instance</i>, that of
  a lawyer of the greatest eminence, who was last year advanced to a
  peerage, and to the highest rank in his profession, who has assumed both
  arms and supporters without the fiat of the College of Arms. The "novi
  homines" of a former age set a better example to those of the present
  day, and were not ashamed to go honestly to the proper office and take
  out their patent of arms, thus "founding a family" who have a
  <i>right</i> to the ensigns of honour which they assume.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Emendations.</i>&mdash;As this is the age of Shakspeare
  emendations, I beg to propose the following for the consideration of the
  numerous readers of "N. &amp; Q." I am the more emboldened to do so, as I
  find several marginal corrections made from time to time are verified by
  the manuscript corrections in <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> folio
  of 1632. These proposed are not, however, there, or I would not have
  troubled you, though it is many months since I first altered the reading
  of my copy. <!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page52"></a>{52}</span></p>

  <p><i>Taming of the Shrew,</i> Act V. Sc. 2.&mdash;On the exit of
  Katharina to "fetch" in the disobedient wives, Lucentio remarks:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Luc.</i> Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Hort.</i> And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Pet.</i> Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,</p>
      <p><i>An awful</i> rule, and right supremacy;</p>
      <p>And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For "an awful rule" I propose to substitute <i>and lawful rule</i>, as
  agreeing better with the text and context; indeed, the whole passage
  indicates it. Petruchio means that the change in Katharina's temper and
  conduct bodes love, peace, law, and order, in contradistinction to awe or
  fear. The repetition of the conjunction <i>and</i> also makes the harmony
  of the language more equal; "and love, and quiet life, and lawful rule,
  and right supremacy," rings evenly to the ear. Considering the number and
  character of the emendations in <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span>
  volume, I have the less hesitation in proposing this one. The language of
  Shakspeare is, as we know it, for the most part so clear, harmonious,
  distinct, and forcible, that I think we are justified in considering any
  obscure, inconsistent, or harsh passage, as having met with some mishap
  either in hearing, transcribing, or in printing. Some months ago, and
  certainly before <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> volume of
  corrections appeared, I forwarded to "N. &amp; Q." (it never appeared) a
  correction from <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, Act V. Sc. 2., where
  Cleopatra, contemplating suicide, says it is&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"To do that thing that ends all other deeds,</p>
      <p>Which shackles accidents, and bolts up change;</p>
      <p>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung.</p>
      <p>The beggar's nurse and Cæsar's."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word "dung" ending the third line, was so evidently <i>dug</i>, or
  nipple, that I thought no man to whom it was pointed out could have a
  doubt about it. <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> remarks in his recent
  volume, "This emendation may, or may not, have been conjectural, but we
  may be pretty sure it is right." I doubt if <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier</span> would have accepted any authority other than that of his
  own folio, although Shakspeare has frequently used the word <i>dug</i> as
  a synonym for nipple, as see <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act I. Sc. 3.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Nurse.</i> And she was wean'd,&mdash;I never shall forget it,&mdash;</p>
      <p>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</p>
      <p>For I had then laid wormwood to my dug.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="i10">&mdash;but, as I said,</p>
      <p>When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple</p>
      <p>Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool,</p>
      <p>To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This quotation proves clearly, I consider, that dug was meant by
  Cleopatra, and not <i>dung</i>; and so I considered before the old
  manuscript correction of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> appeared.
  The words "an awful" are as clearly to my mind <i>and lawful</i>. I
  doubt, however, if they will be so acknowledged, as the use of the words
  "an awful," it may be contended, are countenanced by other passages in
  Shakspeare; I quote the following.</p>

  <p><i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, Act IV. Sc. I.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>3rd Outlaw.</i> Know then, that some of us are gentlemen,</p>
      <p>Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth</p>
      <p>Thrust from the company of <i>awful</i> men."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word "awful" is surely, in this place, <i>lawful</i>; an outlaw
  would be little inclined to consider men as "awful," but the contrary.
  Read the last line as under&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thrust from the company of <i>lawful</i> men,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and the meaning is simple and clear. The outlaws were thrust from the
  company of <i>lawful men</i>, that is, men who obeyed the laws they had
  broken in "the fury of ungovern'd youth."</p>

  <p>In <i>King Richard II.</i>, Act III. Sc. 3., the following use of the
  words <i>lawful</i> and <i>awful</i> occurs:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>K. Rich.</i> We are amazed; and thus long have we stood</p>
      <p>To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</p>
      <p class="i10">[<i>To Northumberland.</i></p>
      <p>Because we thought ourself thy lawful king;</p>
      <p>And if we be, how dare thy joints forget</p>
      <p>To pay their awful duty to our presence?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The meaning in this case is no doubt clear enough, and the words
  "awful duty" may be the right ones; but had they stood <i>lawful duty</i>
  in any old copy, he should have been a bold man who would have proposed
  to substitute <i>awful</i> for <i>lawful</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Second Part of King Henry IV.</i>, Act IV. Sc. 1.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Arch.</i> To us, and to our purposes, confin'd:</p>
      <p>We come within our <i>awful</i> banks again,</p>
      <p>And knit our powers to the arm of peace."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The use of the word "awful" in this passage may be right, but, as in
  the preceding case, I think, had <i>lawful banks</i> stood in any old
  printed copy, or had it even been found in <span class="sc">Mr.
  Collier's</span> volume, the fitness would have been acknowledged.</p>

  <p>Shakspeare used the word "lawful" in many instances where, no doubt,
  it may with reason, strong as any given here, be changed to <i>awful</i>.
  In the historical plays, <i>lawful</i> king, <i>lawful</i> progeny,
  <i>lawful</i> heir, <i>lawful</i> magistrate, <i>lawful</i> earth,
  <i>lawful</i> sword, &amp;c., may be found. These suggestions, like the
  pinch of sand thrown on the old woman's cow, if they do no good, will, I
  trust, do no harm.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Robert Rawlinson</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;A German writer, Professor Hilgers, of
  Aix-la-Chapelle, published in 1852 a pamphlet, in which he endeavoured to
  prove that many passages in Shakspeare, which were originally written in
  verse, have been "degraded" into prose, and quotes several passages from
  the plays <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>in support of his thesis. Professor Hilgers
  says that emendation of the text, by means of such a mode of correction
  as would restore the corrupted verses to their original form, has
  hitherto been almost entirely neglected by commentators, or else employed
  by them with very little ability and success. I have not seen the
  Professor's Treatise, and only write from a short notice which I have
  just perused of it in a German review; but, if what Professor H. states
  be correct, the subject appears to deserve more particular attention from
  the writers in the "N. &amp; Q.," who have devoted their ingenuity and
  research to the illustration of Shakspeare. In the hope of attracting
  them to "fresh fields and pastures new," in which to recreate themselves,
  and to instruct and delight the world-wide readers of the great
  dramatist, I venture to solicit attention to Professor Hilger's pamphlet
  and its subject. In this I only echo the German reviewer's language, who
  most highly praises the Professor's acuteness, and the value of his
  strictures, and promises to return to them at greater length in a future
  number of the periodical in which he writes.</p>

<h3>UNPUBLISHED LETTER.</h3>

  <p>I have thought that the following old letter, from a retired lawyer of
  the seventeenth century to his future son-in-law, might not be altogether
  uninteresting to your readers, as referring to the value of land and
  money at the period when it was written.</p>

  <p class="author">C. W. B.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Since you are pleased to demand my opinion concerning your intended
  purchase, I shall give you it as well as I can upon so short a warning.
  You say, if lett, you suppose it was worth a 130<i>l.</i> per ann&#x16B;.
  I cannot tell by your letter whether the mills, lett at 20<i>l.</i> per
  ann&#x16B;, are a part of y<sup>e</sup> 130<i>l.</i>: if it be, I think
  2600<i>l.</i> a great price, being much above twenty years' purchase,
  considering the lord's rent. But if they are not included in that sum,
  'tis a good twenty years' purchase. Now you must consider what returne
  this will make for your money. I am sure, as times goe, not three per
  cent; and money makes full five, and very seldom, if ever, pays taxes. I
  believe it may be very convenient for you, and it is very advantageous to
  be entire; but if you should contract a debt to buy this estate you will
  be very uneasy, and, if you marry, the first setting out will be
  expensive, and it will be ill taking up money to defray necessary
  charges. I conceive the land is in hand, and not lett; so that, if you
  have not a tenant, you must be at the expence of stocking, w<sup>ch</sup>
  will sett very hard upon you. And you know, w<sup>n</sup> your sister
  marrys, there is a 1000 pounds more to be provided. Pray putt all these
  things together, and propose some way of solving all these difficultys;
  and, if you can, I should be glad to have it annexed to your estate, and
  settled upon the heirs male of your body. Upon w<sup>ch</sup>
  consideration I shall be more inclined to farther your desires in a
  reasonable manner.</p>

  <p>Pray, w<sup>n</sup> you hear any more of that co&#x16B;selor's amours
  send me word, but lett me advise you never to say anything of him or his
  estate that may come to the lady's ears. I hope my Lady Morton will not
  tell M<sup>rs</sup> Tregonell any more than what all the world should
  know. I heard the K<sup>t</sup> had bid adieu to the Woodland Lady. I am
  very glad of it, for I wish him better ffortune. I writt lately to
  S<sup>r</sup> John, who honoured me with a letter. As for public news,
  you have heard, I suppose, of our burning St. Malos and Grandvile; and
  that wee have left a great many of our men before Namur, but they
  continue the siege vigorously. They say the ffrench are about to sett
  downe before Dixmude, to bring us of by revultion. Pray p<sup>r</sup>sent
  mine and my daughter's service to your sister, and believe me to be,

  <p><i>Old Ship.</i>&mdash;It may be of interest to some of your readers
  to learn that the ship which conveyed General Wolfe on his expedition to
  Quebec is still afloat under the name of the "William and Ann."</p>

  <p>She was built in 1759 for a bomb-ketch, and was in dock in the Thames
  a few days since, sound and likely to endure for many years yet: she is
  mostly now engaged in the Honduras and African timber trades, which is in
  itself a proof of her great strength.</p>

  <p><i>The Letter "h" in "humble."</i>&mdash;I was always taught in my
  childhood to sink the <i>h</i> in this word, and was confirmed in this
  habit by the usage of all the well-educated people that I met in those
  days, as also by the authority of every pronouncing dictionary in the
  English language: and to this day hear many people quite as well
  educated, and of as high station in all but literary society, as Mr.
  Dickens, use the same pronunciation; but this eminent writer has thought
  fit of late to proscribe this practice as far as in him lies, by making
  it the Shibboleth of two of the meanest and vilest characters in his
  works. I should like to know whether the aspiration of this letter is due
  to Mr. D.'s London birth and residence, or whether it has become of late
  the general usage of good society. If the latter, it is clear that a new
  edition of <i>Walker</i> is required for the benefit of such as have no
  wish to be confounded with the "Heeps."</p>

  <p>Your late Numbers have given some curious instances of Cockney and
  other rhymes. I am sorry to see that the offensive <i>r</i> not only
  appears to be gaining ground in poetry, but also in the mouths of many
  whose station and education might have been supposed to preserve them
  from this vulgarism. If the masters of our great schools took as much
  pains with their pupils' pronunciation of English, as with that of Latin
  and Greek, we should hear less of this.</p>

  <p><i>"The Angels' Whisper."</i>&mdash;The admirers of that popular song

  similar to the one on which that song is founded.</p>

  <p>The other day our Hindoo nurse was watching our baby asleep, and
  noticing that it frequently smiled, said, "God is talking to it!" The
  tradition, as elicited from this woman, seems to be here, that when a
  child smiles in its sleep, God is saying something pleasing to it; but
  when it cries, He is talking to it of sorrow.</p>

  <p>In numerous original family "Coke documents" in my possession, amongst

  documents<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> and
  public precepts I possess, the latter of which came under the eye of
  Lords Keepers Coventry and Littleton, Sir Edward's name is, in nine cases
  out of ten in five hundred instances, spelt <i>Cooke</i> and <i>Cook</i>;
  thus, I submit, raising an almost irresistible presumption that, however
  the Chief Justice's surname was written, it was pronounced <i>Cook</i>
  and not C<i>o</i>ke.</p>

  <p><i>The Advice supposed to have been given to Julius III.</i>&mdash;The

  addressed to Julius III., Pope of Rome, by certain prelates, has just
  been once more quoted, for the fiftieth time, perhaps, within the present
  generation, as a genuine document, and as proceeding from adherents of
  the Church of Rome. This re-quotation appears in an otherwise useful
  little volume of the Religious Tract Society, entitled <i>The Bible in
  many Tongues</i>, p. 96.; and it may tend to check the use made of the
  supposed Advice or Council to state, what a perusal either of the
  original in Brown's <i>Fasciculus Rerum Expetend. et Fugiend.</i>, or of
  a translation in Gibson's <i>Preservative</i> (vol. i. pp. 183. 191., ed.
  1848), will soon make evident, that the document in question is a piece
  of banter, and must be attributed to the pen of P.&nbsp;P. Vergerio, in whose
  <i>Works</i> it is in fact included, in the single volume published
  Tubing. 1563, fol. 94&mdash;104.</p>

  <p>So frequently has this supposed Advice been cited as a <i>serious</i>
  affair, that the pages of "N. &amp; Q." may be well employed in
  endeavouring to stop the somewhat perverse use of a friendly weapon.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>BISHOP GARDINER "DE VERA OBEDIENTIÂ."</h3>

  <p>It is probable that others of your readers besides myself have had
  good reason to complain that Dr. Maitland has cruelly raised the price of
  this little book to a bibliomaniacal height, by his inimitable
  description of its curious contents and history. (<i>Essays on Subjects
  connected with the Reformation</i>, xvii. xviii. xix.)</p>

<p><!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

  <p>Some of the things which seem to be indubitable respecting the
  original work are these:&mdash;1. That it was first printed in 1535. 2.
  That, consequently, Bishop Burnet (<i>Hist. of Ref.</i>, Part I. b. iii.
  p. 166.: Dublin, 1730) was mistaken in representing it as having been
  written in reply to Cardinal Pole. 3. That there <i>was</i> an octavo
  edition published at Strasburg in 1536, and that Goldastus followed it.
  4. That there was an additional reprint of the tract at London in 1603.
  (Schelhornii, <i>Am&oelig;n. Hist. Eccles.</i>, tom. i. pp. 15. 849.) But
  I am anxious to make three inquiries relative to this really important
  document and its fictitious preface.</p>

  <p>1. The Roane volume, certainly the earliest in English, professes to
  have been printed by "Michal Wood" in 1553. Can we not determine the
  place of its origin by the recollection of the fact, that Bishop Bale's
  <i>Mysterye of Iniquyte, or Confutation of Ponce Pantolabus</i>, was
  printed at <i>Geneva</i> by "Mychael Woode" in 1545?</p>

  <p>2. With regard to the typographical achievements of the Brocards, is
  it not rather an <i>apropos</i> circumstance, that "Biliosus Balæus," as
  Fuller calls him, was the author of a <i>Historia Divi Brocardi</i>?
  (Ware's <i>Works</i>, ii. 325.)</p>

  <p>3. May not Bale (or <i>Baal</i>, according to Pits) be suspected to
  have been the composer of the Bonnerian Preface? He might have reckoned
  it among the many <i>Facetias et Jocos</i> which he declares that he had
  put forth. It is observable that, while the writer of this Preface
  designates Bishop Gardiner as the "common cutthrot of Englande," the same
  title is bestowed upon Bonner in the Foxian Letter addressed to him by
  "an unknown person" (Strype's <i>Memor.</i> iii., Catal. p. 161.: London,
  1721), and which, from internal evidence taken from the part relating to
  Philpot, must be referred to the year 1555. The style of these
  performances is similar; and let "gaie Gardiner, blow-bole Boner, trusti
  Tonstal, and slow-bellie Samson" of the Preface be compared with
  "glorious Gardiner, blow-bolle Bonner, tottering Tunstal, wagtaile
  Weston, and carted Chicken." (Bale's <i>Declaration of Bonner's
  Articles</i>, fol. 90. b., London, 1561.)</p>

  <p><i>Curious Custom of ringing Bells for the Dead.</i>&mdash;In
  Marshfield, Massachusets, it has been customary for a very long period to
  ring the bell of the parish church most violently for eight or ten
  minutes, whenever a death occurs in the village; then to strike it slowly
  three times three, which makes known to the inhabitants that a man or boy
  has expired, and finally to toll it the number of times that the deceased
  had numbered years of existence.</p>

  this custom ever did, or does now, exist in the mother country?</p>

  note tells us he knows "not when or where." I do not find it in the
  edition of his works published in 1846, nor have I been able to discover
  it in any of the journals, to which he contributed, that have fallen in
  my way. Have any of your correspondents met with it?</p>

  <p><i>Peculiar Ornament in Crosthwaite Church.</i>&mdash;On lately
  visiting Crosthwaite Church, Cumberland, I was exceedingly struck with
  the great peculiarity of a carving, pointed out to me by the sexton, on
  the left jambs of all the windows in the north and south aisles, both
  inside and out. It is in the form of a circle with eight radiations, and
  always occurs about half-way between the shoulder of the arch and the
  sill. During the late restoration of the church, it has been covered with
  plaster in every case in the interior, save one in the north aisle, which
  is left very distinct. It does not appear on any of the windows at the
  east end or in the tower. I noticed a similar figure over the stone
  door-way of the old inn at Threlkeld, with the letters C G inscribed on
  one side, and the date 1688 on the other. The sexton said, he had never
  been able to obtain any intelligence as to its symbolical meaning or
  history, although he had inquired of nearly every one who had been to see
  the church. Can any of your correspondents throw a light upon the
  subject?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Far be it from every Christian, that anything concerning the city of
  Canterbury be diminished or changed, in present or <i>future times</i>,
  which was appointed by our predecessor Pope Gregory, <i>however human
  circumstances may be changed</i>: but more especially by the authority of
  St. Peter, the chief of the Apostles, we command and ordain, that the
  city of Canterbury <i>shall ever hereafter be esteemed the Metropolitan

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This last (the figure of Erin), as described, is purely ideal, but
  legitimately brought in, as Hogan's figure of 'Hibernia' occupied a

  family of Done, of Utkington, in the British Museum, Additional MS. No.

<h3>NAMES OF PLACES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 536.)</p>

  <p>I have been travelling so much about in the country since I left
  England, that I have not always the opportunity of seeing your "N. &amp;
  Q." until long after the publication of the different Numbers. I have in
  this way seen some Queries put to me about matters connected with the
  history of the Danish settlements in England. But as I have had no
  particular information to give, I have not thought it worth while to
  write to say that I know nothing of any great consequence.</p>

  <p>Just when I left Copenhagen, some days ago, a friend of mine showed me
  that <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span>, of Ormesby in Norfolk, asked
  some questions regarding the Danish names of places in Norfolk.</p>

  <p>In answer to them I beg to state, that all the names terminating in
  <i>-by</i> unquestionably are of Danish origin. <span class="sc">Mr.
  Taylor</span> is perfectly right in supposing that several of these names
  of places contain the names of the old Danish conquerors. But I do not
  think that Ormesby originally has been Gormsby. Gorm certainly is the
  same as Guthrum; but both of these names are distinctly different from
  the name "Orme" or "Orm," which, in our old language, signifies a
  serpent, and also a worm. (The famous ship, on board of which King Olaf
  Tryggveson was killed in the year 1000, was called "Ormen hin lange,"
  <i>i.e.</i> the long serpent.) I have observed that several English
  families (undoubtedly of old Scandinavian descent) at this day have the
  family-name "Orm" or "Orme."</p>

  <p>Among the other names of places quoted by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Taylor</span>, Rollesby most probably must be derived from the name
  "Rollo" or "Rolf;" but I regard the origin of the other names as being
  much more doubtful. If we had the original forms of these names, it might
  have been easier to decide upon it. As the names are now, I do not see
  anything purely Scandinavian in them, except the termination <i>-by</i>.
  It is not at all unlikely that the name Ashby or Askeby might have been
  called so from "Ash-trees" (Danish "Ask eller Esk"), but I dare not
  venture into conjectures of this kind.</p>

  <p>I should be very happy if I in any other way could be of any service
  to <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> in his researches about the Danish
  settlements in East Anglia. His remarks upon the situation of the
  villages with Danish names are most interesting and instructive. I always
  sincerely wish that inhabitants of the different old Danish districts in
  the North and East of England would, in the same way, take up the
  question about the Danish influence, as I feel fully convinced that very
  remarkable and important elucidations might be gained to the history of
  England during a long and hitherto very little known period.</p>

<h3>CLEANING OLD OAK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 620.; Vol. viii., p. 45.)</p>

  <p>Having been so frequently benefited by the instruction, especially
  photographic, issuing from your most useful periodical, I feel myself
  almost bound to contribute my mite of information whenever I may chance
  to have the power of doing so; consequently, should you not get a better
  method of assisting <span class="sc">Mr. F.&nbsp;M. Middleton</span> out of
  his difficulty of softening old paint, as describe in the "N. &amp; Q.,"
  No. 191., I beg to offer him the following, and from experience I can
  vouch for its certainty of leading him to the desired result.</p>

  <p>Some years since, having had occasion to enter a lumber-room of an old
  building, I was struck with the antiquated appearance of an arm-chair,
  which had, in days long gone by, been daubed over with a dirty bluish
  paint. Finding, on inquiry, that its owner set no particular value on it,
  I met with but little difficulty in inducing him to make an exchange with
  me for a good mahogany one. Soon after its being brought into my house,
  one of my domestics discovered that it positively swarmed with a species
  of lice, issuing from innumerable minute worm-holes and crevices, which
  of course rendered it in its present state worse than useless. Determined
  not to be deprived of my prize, I resolved on attempting to rid it of
  this troublesome pest by washing it over with a strong solution of
  caustic soda, made by mixing some quick-lime with a very strong solution
  of the common washing soda (impure carbonate of soda), and pouring off
  the clear supernatant liquid for use. This proceeding, much to my
  satisfaction, not only succeeded in entirely getting rid of the vermin,
  but on my servant's scrubbing the chair with a hard brush and hot soap
  and water, I found that the caustic soda had formed a kind of soap, by
  chemically uniting with the oil contained in the old paint, thereby
  reducing it to such a state of softness, that by a few vigorous
  applications and soakings of the above-named solution, and subsequent
  scrubbings, my new favourite was also freed from its ugly time-worn
  jacket of dirty paint, discovering underneath a beautifully carved and
  darkly coloured oaken surface.</p>

  <p>After being perfectly dried and saturated with linseed oil, it was
  frequently well rubbed, and the <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>chair stands to this day, like some of the
  valuable discoveries made by the alchemists when in search of the Elixir
  Vitæ, or the Philosopher's Stone, an example of a fortunate and
  unexpected disclosure made when not directly in search of it. I have
  since learnt that a fluid possessing the above-named detergent qualities,
  is to be purchased at some of the oil and colour shops, the formula for
  its preparation being kept a secret.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry Herbert Hele.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Ashburton, Devonshire.</p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;In making the solution on a caustic alkali, perhaps I
  should have said that the common carbonate of potass of commerce will do
  as well as the common carbonate of soda, if not better, from the
  probability of its making a stronger solution.</p>

  <p>The following recipe for taking paint off old oak is from No. 151. of
  <i>The Builder</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Make a strong solution of American potash (which can be bought at any
  colour-shop, and resembles burnt brick in appearance); mix this with
  sawdust into a kind of paste, and spread it all over the paint, which
  will become softened in a few hours, and is then easily removed by
  washing with cold water. If, after the wood has dried, it becomes
  cracked, apply a solution of hot size with a brush, which will bind it
  well together and make it better for varnishing, as well as destroy the
  beetle which is often met with in old oak, and is erroneously called the
  worm."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following is also from the same Number:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To make dark oak pale in colour, which is sometimes a desideratum,
  apply with a brush a little dilute nitric acid judiciously; and to stain
  light oak dark, use the dregs of black ink and burnt amber mixed. It is
  better to try these plans on oak of little value at first, as, to make a
  good job, requires care, practice, and attention."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">H. C. K.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">F. M. Middleton</span> will find that American
  potash, soft soap, and warm water, will remove paint from oak. The
  mixture should be applied with a paint-brush, and allowed to remain on
  until the paint and it can be removed by washing with warm water and a
  hard brush.</p>

<h3>BURIAL IN AN ERECT POSTURE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 5.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Cheverells</span> refers to the
  "tradition" of one of the Harcourt family being buried in an erect
  posture, and asks, "Is the probability of this being the case supported
  by any, and what instances?" As this Query has been raised, it may be
  worth while to mention the following circumstance, as a singular
  illustration of a remarkable subject; though (as will be seen) the actual
  burial in an erect posture is here also probably "traditional."</p>

  <p>Towards the close of the last century, there lived in Kidderminster an
  eccentric person of the name of Orton (<i>not</i> that Orton, the friend
  of Doddridge, who passed some time in the town), but "Job Orton," the
  landlord of the Bell Inn. During his lifetime he erected his tomb in the
  parish churchyard, with this <i>memento-mori</i> inscription graven in
  large characters on the upper slab:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Job Orton, a man from Leicestershire;</p>
      <p>And when he's dead, he must lie under here."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This inscription remains unaltered to this day, and may be seen on the
  right-hand of the broad walk on the north side of the spacious
  churchyard. His coffin was constructed at the same time; and, until it
  should be required for other and personal purposes, was used as a
  <i>wine-bin</i>. But, to carry his eccentricity even to the grave, he
  left strict orders that he should be buried in an <i>erect posture</i>:
  and "tradition" (of course) says that his request was complied with. Your
  correspondent says that tradition "assigns no reason for the peculiarity"
  of the Harcourt knight's burial; but tradition has been more explicit in
  Job Orton's case, whose <i>reason</i> (?) for his erect posture in the
  tomb was, that at the last day he might be able to rise from his grave
  before his wife, who was buried in the usual horizontal manner! Job Orton
  appears to have had a peculiar talent for the composition of epitaphs;
  as, in his more playful moments, he was accustomed to tell his
  better-half that if he outlived her he should put the following lines on
  her tombstone:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Esther Orton&mdash;a bitter, sour weed;</p>
      <p>God never lov'd her, nor increas'd her seed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He seems, however, to have spared her this gratuitous insult. As a
  farther illustration of the characters of this singular couple, the
  following anecdote is told. Esther Orton having frequently declared, that
  she should "never die happy until she had rolled in riches," Job, like a
  good husband, determined to secure his wife's happiness. Having sold some
  land for a thousand pounds, he insisted that the money should be paid
  wholly in guineas. Taking these home in a bag, he locked his wife up in a
  room; knocked her down, opened his bag of guineas, and raining the golden
  wealth upon her, rolled his Danae over and over in the coin. "And now,
  Esther," said Job Orton, "thee mayst die as soon as thee pleases: for
  thee'st had thy wish, and <i>roll'd in riches</i>."</p>

<h3>LAWYERS' BAGS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 557.)</p>

  <p>Additional evidence of the fact that lawyers used to carry
  <i>green</i> bags towards the end of the <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>seventeenth century, is
  to be found in the <i>Plain Dealer</i>, a comedy by Wycherley.</p>

  <p>One of the principal characters in the play is the Widow Blackacre, a
  petulant, litigious woman, always in law, and mother of Jerry Blackacre,
  "a true raw squire under age and his mother's government, <i>bred to the
  law</i>."</p>

  <p>In Act I. Sc. 1., I find the following stage directions:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Enter Widow Blackacre with a mantle and a <i>green</i> bag, and
  several papers in the other hand. Jerry Blackacre, her son, in a gown,
  laden with <i>green</i> bags, following her."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Act III. Sc. 1. the widow is called impertinent and ignorant by a
  lawyer of whom she demands back her fee, on his returning her brief and
  declining to plead for her. This draws from her the following reply:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Impertinent again and ignorant to me! Gadsbodikins, you puny upstart
  in the law to use me so, you <i>green bag</i> carrier, you murderer of
  unfortunate causes," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Farther on, in the same scene, Freeman, a gentleman well educated, but
  of a broken fortune, a complier with the age, thus admonishes Jerry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Come, Squire, let your mother and your trees fall as she pleases,
  rather than wear this gown and carry <i>green</i> bags all thy life, and
  be pointed at for a tony. But you shall be able to deal with her yet the
  common way. Thou shalt make false love to some lawyer's daughter, whose
  father, upon the hopes of thy marrying her, shall lend thee money and law
  to preserve thy estate and trees."</p>

  <p class="author">"Henley Street, July 6.</p>

  <p>"Your insertion of the annexed letter from my brother-in-law, Mr. John
  Stewart, of Pau, will much oblige me. The utility of this mode of
  reproduction seems indisputable. In reference to its concluding
  paragraph, I will only add, that the <i>publication</i> of concentrated
  microscopic editions of works of reference&mdash;maps, atlases,
  logarithmic tables, or the concentration for pocket use of private notes
  and MSS., &amp;c., &amp;c., and innumerable other similar
  applications&mdash;is brought within the reach of any one who possesses a
  small achromatic object-glass of an inch or an inch and a half in
  diameter, and a brass tube, with slides before and behind the lens of a
  fitting diameter to receive the plate or plates to be operated
  upon,&mdash;central or nearly central rays only being required. The
  details are too obvious to need mention.&mdash;I am, &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="author">"<span class="sc">J. F. W. Herschel.</span></p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p class="author">"Pau, June 11.</p>

  <p>"Dear Herschel.&mdash;I sent you some time ago a few small-sized
  studies of animals from the life, singly and in flocks, upon
  collodionised glass. The great rapidity of exposition required for such
  subjects, being but the fraction of a second, together with the very
  considerable depth and harmony obtained, gave me reason to hope that ere
  this I should have been able to produce microscopic pictures of animated
  objects. For the present, I have been interrupted. Meantime, one of my
  friends here, Mr. Heilmann, following the same pursuit, has lighted on an
  ingenious method of taking from glass negatives positive impressions of
  different dimensions, and with all the delicate minuteness which the
  negative may possess. This discovery is likely, I think, to extend the
  resources and the application of photography,&mdash;and with some
  modifications, which I will explain, to increase the power of
  reproduction to an almost unlimited amount. The plan is as
  follows:&mdash;The negative to be reproduced is placed in a slider at one
  end (<i>a</i>) of a camera or other box, constructed to exclude the light
  throughout. The surface prepared for the reception of the
  positive&mdash;whether albumen, collodion, or paper&mdash;is placed in
  another slider, as usual, at the opposite extremity (<i>c</i>) of the
  box, and intermediately between the two extremities (at <i>b</i>) is
  placed a lens. The negative at <i>a</i> is presented to the light of the
  sky, care being taken that no rays enter the box but those traversing the
  partly transparent negative. These rays are received and directed by the
  lens at <i>b</i> upon the sensitive surface at <i>c</i>, and the
  impression of the negative is there produced with a rapidity proportioned
  to the light admitted, and the sensibility of the surface presented. By
  varying the distances between <i>a</i> and <i>c</i>, and <i>c</i> and
  <i>b</i>, any dimension required may be given to the positive impression.
  Thus, from a medium-sized negative, I have obtained negatives four times
  larger than the original, and other impressions reduced thirty times,
  capable of figuring on a watch-glass, brooch, or ring.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly one of the most interesting and important advantages
  gained by this simple arrangement is, the power of varying the dimensions
  of a picture or portrait. Collodion giving results of almost microscopic
  minuteness, such negatives bear enlarging considerably without any very
  perceptible deterioration in that respect. Indeed, as regards portraits,
  there is a gain instead of a loss; the power of obtaining good and
  pleasing likenesses appears to me decidedly increased, the facility of
  subsequent enlargement permitting them to be taken sufficiently small, at
  a sufficient distance (and therefore with greater rapidity and certainty)
  <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>to
  avoid all the focal distortion so much complained of,&mdash;while the due
  enlargement of a portrait taken on glass has the effect, moreover, of
  depriving it of that hardness of outline so objectionable in a collodion
  portrait, giving it more artistic effect, and this without quitting the
  perfect focal point as has been suggested.</p>

  <p>"But there are many other advantages obtained by this process. For
  copying by engraving, &amp;c. the exact dimension required of any picture
  may at once be given to be copied from.</p>

  <p>"A very small photographic apparatus can thus be employed when a large
  one might be inconvenient or impracticable, the power of reproducing on a
  larger scale being always in reserve. Independent of this power of
  varying the size, positives so taken of the <i>same</i> dimension as the
  negative reproduce, as will be readily understood, much more completely
  the finer and more delicate details of the negatives than positives taken
  by any other process that I am acquainted with.</p>

  <p>"The negative also may be reversed in its position at <i>a</i> so as
  to produce upon glass a positive to be seen either upon or under the
  glass. And while the rapidity and facility of printing are the same as in
  the case of positives taken on paper prepared with the iodide of silver,
  the negatives, those on glass particularly, being so easily injured, are
  much better preserved, all actual contact with the positive being
  avoided. For the same reason, by this process positive impressions can be
  obtained not only upon wet paper, &amp;c., but also upon hard inflexible
  substances, such as porcelain, ivory, glass, &amp;c.,&mdash;and upon this
  last, the positives being transparent are applicable to the stereoscope,
  magic lantern, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"By adopting the following arrangement, this process may be used
  largely to increase the power and speed of reproduction with little loss
  of effect. From a positive thus obtained, say on collodion, <i>several
  hundred</i> negatives may be produced either on paper or on albumenised
  glass. If on the latter, and the dimension of the original negative is
  preserved, the loss in minuteness of detail and harmony is almost
  imperceptible, and even when considerably enlarged, is so trifling as in
  the majority of cases to prove no objection in comparison with the
  advantage gained in size, while in not a few cases, as already stated,
  the picture actually gains by an augmentation of size. Thus, by the
  simultaneous action, if necessary, of some hundreds of negatives, many
  thousand impressions of the same picture may be produced in the course of
  a day.</p>

  <p>"I cannot but think, therefore, that this simple but ingenious
  discovery will prove a valuable addition to our stock of photographic
  manipulatory processes. It happily turns to account and utilises one of
  the chief excellencies of collodion&mdash;that extreme minuteness of
  detail which from its excess becomes almost a defect at
  times,&mdash;toning it down by increase of size till the harshness is
  much diminished, and landscapes, always more or less unpleasing on
  collodion from that cause, are rendered somewhat less dry and crude.</p>

  <p>"A very little practice will suffice to show the operator the quality
  of glass negatives&mdash;I mean as to vigour and development&mdash;best
  adapted for reproducing positives by this method. He will also find that
  a great power of correction is obtained, by which overdone parts in the
  negative can be reduced and others brought up. Indeed, in consequence of
  this and other advantages, I have little doubt that this process will be
  very generally adopted in portrait taking.</p>

  <p>"Should your old idea of preserving public records in a concentrated
  form on microscopic negatives ever be adopted, the immediate positive
  reproduction on an enlarged readable scale, without the possibility of
  injury to the plate, will be of service.</p>

  directs that the ring be put on the right hand (Schmid, <i>Liturgik</i>,

  <p>But the practice of the Roman communion in general agrees with that of

  on the fourth finger of the left, in order to mark the difference between
  the marriage ring, the symbol of a love which is mixed with carnal
  affection, and the episcopal ring, the symbol of entire chastity.

  <i>Polyglot Bible</i>, 1655-7, besides an odd volume of the same work
  (Job to Malachi), 1656, uncut. It is probable that many of the books have
  been lost, as the room in which they were kept was used as a repository
  for discarded ecclesiastical appliances, and, latterly, for charity
  blankets during summer. In 1840, with the consent of the late bishop of
  Norwich, and of the rector and churchwardens of the parish, the remaining
  volumes (about 170) were removed to the public library room, and placed
  under the care of the committee of that institution. A catalogue of them
  was then printed. The greater part have been repaired, with the aid of a
  donation of 10<i>l.</i> from a former inhabitant, who had reason to
  believe that some of the works had been lost in consequence of their
  having been in his hands many years ago. Are there not numerous instances
  elsewhere in which this example might be copied with propriety?</p>

  <p><i>Bacon</i> (Vol. ii., p. 247.; Vol. iii., p. 41.).&mdash;I think
  that you have not noticed one very common use of this word, as evidently
  meaning <i>beechen.</i> Schoolboys call tops made of boxwood,
  <i>boxers;</i> while the inferior ones, which are generally made of
  beechwood, they call <i>bacons.</i></p>

  <p><i>Angel-beast&mdash;Cleek&mdash;Longtriloo</i> (Vol. v., p.
  559.).&mdash;An account of these games, the nature of which is required
  by your correspondent, is given in the <i>Compleat Gamester</i>,
  frequently reprinted in the latter part of the seventeenth century. The
  first, which is there called <i>beast</i>, is said to derive its name
  from the French <i>la bett</i>, meaning, no doubt, <i>bête</i>. It seems
  to have resembled the game of loo. <i>Gleek</i> is the proper name of the
  second game, and not <i>check</i>, as your correspondent suggests. It was
  played by three persons, and the cards bore the names of Tib, Tom, Tiddy,
  Towser, and Tumbler. Hence we may conclude that it was an old English
  game. The third game, or <i>lanterloo</i>, is evidently the original form
  of the game now known as <i>loo</i>. Its name would seem to indicate a
  Dutch origin.</p>

  <p><i>Hans Krauwinckel</i> (Vol. v., p. 450.).&mdash;When the ground in
  Charterhouse Square was opened in 1834, for the purposes of sewerage (I
  believe), vast numbers of bones and skeletons were found, being the
  remains, as was supposed, of those who died of the Plague in 1348, and
  had been interred in that spot, as forming a part of Pardon Churchyard,
  which had lately been purchased by Sir Walter Manny, for the purposes of
  burial, and attached to the Carthusian convent there. Among the bones a
  few galley halfpence, and other coins, were found, as also a considerable
  number of abbey counters or jettons. I do not recollect if there was any
  date on the counters but the name "Hans Krauwinckel" occurred on some of
  them which fell into my possession, and which I gave some years ago to
  the Museum of the City Library, Guildhall. If these were coeval, as was
  generally supposed, with the Plague of 1348, it is singular that the same
  name should be found on abbey counters with the date 1601. I should be
  obliged if any of your correspondents could inform me when the use of
  jettons ceased in England; and whether Pardon Churchyard was used as a
  place of sepulture after 1348, and, if so, how long?</p>

  <p><i>Muffs worn by Gentlemen.</i>&mdash;In one of Goldsmith's
  <i>Essays</i> I remember well an allusion to the practice. The writer of
  the letter, or essay, states that he met his female cousin in the Mall,
  and after some sparring conversation, she ridicules him for carrying "a
  nasty <i>old</i>-fashioned [<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1760] muff;"
  and his retort is, that he "heartily wishes it were a tippet, for her
  sake,"&mdash;glancing at her dress, which was, I suppose, somewhat what
  we moderns call "décolletée".</p>

  <p><i>Detached Church Towers.</i>&mdash;The Norman tower at Bury St.
  Edmund's should not be included in the lists. Although now used as the
  bell tower of the neighbouring church of St. James, it was erected
  several centuries before the church, and was known as the "Great Gate of
  the Churchyard," or the "Great Gate of the Church of St. Edmund." It
  would be very desirable to add to the list the date of the tower, and its
  distance from the church.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Buriensis.</span></p>

  <p>Add to the list the modern Roman Catholic chapel at Baltinglass,
  Ireland. It has a detached tower built in a field above it, and, although
  devoid of architectural beauty, is so placed that it appears an integral
  part of the chapel from almost any point of view.</p>

  <p><i>Old Fogie</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 354. 559. 632.).&mdash;Whether the
  origin of this term be Irish, Scotch, or Swedish I know not; but I cannot
  help stating the significant meaning which, as an Edinburgh boy at the
  beginning of the century, I was taught to attach to it. Every High-School
  boy agreed in applying it to the veterans of the Castle garrison, to the
  soldiers of the Town Guard (veterans also, and especial foes of my
  school-mates), and more generally to any old and objectionable gentleman,
  civil or military. It implied that, like stones which have ceased to
  roll, they had obtained the proverbial covering of <i>moss</i>, or, as it
  is called in Scotland (probably in Ireland also), <i>fog</i>. I have
  heard in Scotland the "<i>Moss</i> Rose" called the "<i>Fogie</i> Rose;"
  and there is a well-known species of the humble bee which has its nest in
  a mossy bank, and is itself clothed with a moss-like covering: its name
  among the Scottish peasantry is the <i>fogie</i> bee.</p>

  <p><i>Clem</i> (Vol. vii., p. 615.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.

  support of his opinion; admitting, however, that it is usually rendered
  <i>starve</i>. Now, whatever may have been the root of this word, or
  whencesoever it may have been derived, I think it must be admitted that
  <i>starve</i> is the correct meaning of the word in these passages. Let
  the reader test it by substituting <i>starve</i> for <i>clem</i> in each
  case. In Cheshire and Lancashire the word is in common use to this day,
  and invariably means <i>starved</i> for want of food. Of a thin,
  emaciated child it is said, "His mother <i>clems</i> him." A person
  exceedingly hungry says, "I'm welly <i>clem'd</i>; I'm almost or
  well-nigh <i>starved</i>." It is the ordinary appeal of a beggar in the
  streets, when asking for food.</p>

  <p><i>Humbug</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 550. 631.).&mdash;I do not remember any
  earlier use of this word than in Fielding's <i>Amelia</i>, 1751. Its
  origin is involved in obscurity: but may it not be a corruption of the
  Latin <i>ambages</i>, or the singular ablative <i>ambage</i>? which
  signifies <i>quibbling, subterfuge</i>, and that kind of conduct which is
  generally supposed to constitute <i>humbug</i>. It is very possible that
  it may have been pedantically introduced in the seventeenth century. May,
  in his translation of Lucan, uses the word <i>ambages</i> as an English
  word.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. T. Riley.</span></p>

  <p>A severe instance of the use of the term "humbug" occurred in a court
  of justice. A female in giving her evidence repeatedly used this term. In
  her severe cross-examination, the counsel (a very plain, if not an ugly
  person) observed she had frequently used the term humbug, and desired to
  know what she meant by it, and to <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>have an explanation; to
  which she replied, "Why, Sir, if I was to say you were a very handsome
  man, would you not think I was humbugging you?" The counsel sat down
  perfectly satisfied.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Isaac Newton and Voltaire on Railway Travelling</i> (Vol.

  <p><i>Sir John Vanbrugh</i> (Vol. vii., p. 619.).&mdash;Sir John Vanbrugh

  Ghent in Flanders. The Duke of Alva's persecution drove him to England,
  where he became a merchant in London. Giles, the son of this refugee,
  resided in Chester, became rich by trade, and married the youngest
  daughter of Sir Dudley Carleton, by whom he had eight sons, of whom Sir
  John Vanbrugh was the second. The presumption is he was born in Chester,
  but the precise date is unknown.</p>

  <p><i>Erroneous Forms of Speech</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 329.
  632.).&mdash;With regard to your two correspondents E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R. and M., I
  hold that, with Cowper's disputants, "both are right and both are
  wrong."</p>

  <p>The name of the <i>field</i> beet is, in the language of the
  unlearned, <i>mangel-wurzel</i>, "the root of poverty." It acquired that
  name from having been used as food by the poor in Germany during a time
  of great famine. Turning to Buchanan's <i>Technological Dictionary</i>, I
  find,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Mangel-wurzel.</i> Field beet; a variety between the red and
  white. It has as yet been only partially cultivated in Britain."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In reference to the assertion of your later correspondent, that "such
  a thing as mangel-wurzel is not known on the Continent," I would ask if
  either he or his friends are familiar with half the beautiful and
  significant terms applied to English flowers and herbs? If he prefer
  using mangold for beet, he is quite at liberty to do so, and I believe on
  sufficiently good authority. What says Noehden, always a leading
  authority in German:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Mangold.</i> Red beet; name of some other plants, such as lungwort
  and sorrel."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mangold is here, then, a generic term, standing for other plants
  equally with the beet. One suggestion, however; I would recommend the
  generic term, when used at all, to be used alone, leaving the more
  familiar appellation as it stands, for the adoption of those who prefer
  the homely but suggestive phraseology to which it belongs.</p>

  <p class="author">E. L. H.</p>

  <p><i>Devonianisms</i> (Vol. vii., p. 630.).&mdash;<i>Plum</i>, adj. I am
  at a loss for the origin of this word as employed in Devonshire in the
  sense of "soft," <i>e.g.</i> "a <i>plum</i> bed:" meaning a soft, downy
  bed.</p>

  <p>Query: Can it be from the Latin <i>pluma</i>? And if so, what is its
  history?</p>

  <p>There is also a verb <i>to plum</i>, which is obscure. Dough, when
  rising under the influence of heat and fermentation, is said to be
  <i>plumming</i> well; and the word <i>plum</i>, as an adjective, is used
  as the opposite of <i>heavy</i> with regard to currant and other cakes
  when baked. If the cake rises well in the oven, it is commonly said that
  it is "nice and plum;" and <i>vice versâ</i>, that it is heavy.</p>

  <p><i>Clunk</i>, verb. This word is used by the common people, more
  especially the peasantry, to denote the swallowing of masses of
  unmasticated food; and of morsels that may not be particularly relished,
  such as fat. What is the origin of the word?</p>

  <p><i>Dollop</i>, subs. This word, as well as the one last-named, is very
  expressive in the vocabulary of the vulgar. It is applied to lumps of any
  substances, whether food or otherwise. Such a phrase as this might be
  heard: "What a <i>dollop</i> of fat you have given me!" "Well," would be
  the reply, "if you don't like it, <i>clunk</i> it at once." I should be
  glad to be enlightened as to the etymology of this term.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
